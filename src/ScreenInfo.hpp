  //
  // in general, anything (not just rasterization) which needs to query the
  // screen in any way must be able to get its information solely through
  // a screen_info object; furthermore, it is best if such queries always
  // go through the abstract interface - meaning that the abstract interface
  // for l3d_screen_info contains some entries which are not meaningful for
  // all concrete type of l3d_screen_info.
  //
  // this is a fat interface.
  //
  // we could create a complicated inheritance graph of screen_info classes -
  // those indexed or not indexed, those with or without buffer pointers,
  // those with or without color setting routines - one subclass for every
  // possible combination of screen_info features, but this is a bit
  // too much IMHO - such a hierarchy does not bring any useable benefit,
  // and there is no criteria I know of for deciding what groupings of
  // features are logically useful (e.g. here I need an indexed color-settable
  // screeninfo, there I need an rgb color-settable with bufferpointer,
  // and there I need an indexed non-color-settable with bufferpointer).
